Given an NxN grid of letters find words.  Word search puzzle solver.
what about a NxM gird?

Several approaches:

1. Brute force.
Start at upper left of grid (0,0) read the letter, search the dictionary for a 
match.  If match not found add the next letter to the right, search the dictionary
for a match.  Continue until end of row.  Start again at (0,0) and add letters 
going down... repeat diagonally.  Would also have to consider words that are 
backwards.

This would be the slowest way.
What is the complexity?....

2. search grid
for each word in dictionary
A. search row n
B. if not found reverse the letters in row n and search again
C. if not found and next row goto next row and return to A.
if word not found
D. search column c
E. if not found reverse the letters in column c and sarch again
F. if not found and next column goto next column and return to D.
if word not found
G. search diagonal d
H. if not found reverse the letters in d and search again
I. if not found and next diagonal goto next diagonal and return to G.
if word not found ERROR!!!
